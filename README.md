# Welcome to my portfolio! 

This is where I will show off the skills that I have developed during the Rutgers Web Development Coding Bootcamp and after graduation. This portfolio has an About Me page which includes a picture of myself and a short summary of me. This page also has a portfolio page where I list the projects I completed during the bootcamp using agile methodology. As I complete more projects on my own, they will go on this page as well.
